1. To cateogrize the listener's audio aura I would use the average of the following parameters of the top 100 songs of the listener:
    a. Energy
    b. Danceability
    c. Loudness
    d. Valence
    e. Tempo
    f. Speechiness
High energy moving songs will score high in all of these parameters, while a soothing, calm song will score low in almost all the parameters.


2. Even after considering these many parameters, the result might still not be the best fit due to the following reasons:
    a. The genre of songs that the listener's favorite artist mostly produces is not taken into account. This could improve the accuracy of the listener's mood.
    b. The duration of songs also tells the kind of songs that the listener appreciates. In most cases, high energy songs are shorter while songs that have depth take time.
