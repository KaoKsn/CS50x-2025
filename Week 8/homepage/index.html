                Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie was an American computer scientist fondly remembered as the
                co-creator of the <a href="c.html">C Programming Language</a>,
                the <a href="unix.html">Unix operating system</a>,
                and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_(programming_language)'>B Programming Language</a>
                with long-time colleague <a href="thompson.html">Ken Thompson</a>.
                Ritchie and Thompson were awarded the Turing Award from the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) in 1983,
                the IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 1990,
                and the National Medal of Technology from President Bill Clinton in 1999.
                Ritchie served as the head of Lucent Technologies System Software Research Department when he retired in 2007.

                Dennis was born in New York. His father, Alistair E. Ritchie was a scientist at Bell Labs
                where Ritchie would go on to work at.Dennis completed his school education from Summit High School.
                He would move on to obtain degrees in physics and applied mathematics from Harvard University.

                <h4>Career</h4>
                Dennis's work at AT&T Bell Labs would move on to revolutionize computer science forever.
                His worked for the Labs from the year 1967 to 2007 during which he co-created the Unix opearting system alongside his
                collegue Ken Thompson, introducing principles such as modularity, multitasking and protability which became a standard in OS design.
                <p>In the year 1969, Ritchie developed the C programming language which succeeded languages like B and BCPL.
                    By 1973, Ritchie and Ken rewrote the entire Unix kernel in C making it the first OS to be written in a high level language.
                    In 1978, Ritchie co-authored "The C Programming Language" with Brian Kernighan, a foundational text on C. The second edition of the same was
                    publish in the year 1988 which reflected the changes introduced by the ANSI C standard(C89).
